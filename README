Scalar::Util::Clone version 0.10
================================

Scalar::Util::Clone - recursively copy datatypes using perl's builtin functions

This module exports a clone() function which unlocks the builtin functionality perl uses to clone a new interpreter
and its values. As such, it is capable of cloning all perl datatypes, including weak references, hashes with shared keys,
hashes with UTF8 keys, restricted hashes, tied variables, regex objects, and other curios lurking in Perl's intestines.
Because the clone operation is performed at the lowest level, copying the datatype's internals rather than reconstructing
it via the public API, the operation is fast and comprehensive, and produces values that exactly match their original
(for instance, Data::Dumper dumps of hashes are always guaranteed to be the same as those of the original).

For performance reasons, the following types are passed through transparently rather than being deep cloned:
formats, code refs, typeglobs, IO handles, and stashes.

See the POD for more info.
